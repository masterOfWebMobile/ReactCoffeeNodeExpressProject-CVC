####How can I be more successful in online dating?
Photos are important. Really! We cannot emphasize enough how important good, easy to see, appealing photos are to your success in line dating. In general, there is no secret in being successful - you only need to be yourself. But be sure to be active, have a lively profile, send lots of flirts and emails, and browse many profiles. And again, uploading a photo increases your chances of receiving an answer by 30-40 times. If you upload more than one photo you are even more likely to attract somebody's attention.

## More questions you've asked us about CurvesConnect

[REF](#){: name=qD1 .ref}
####How should I get started?
First, it is really important that you complete a profile. People will not respond well to you if you don't spend some time writing about yourself, your values, your lifestyle, what is important to you and what you are looking for in a relationship. Also, having a photo is essential. If you don't have a photo people tend to think you are hiding something. You also will not show up in as many search results. So getting a good profile up is really the first step. Next, you can start searching.

[REF](#){: name=qD3 .ref}
####What happens when I send an  email? How does the person know I sent it to him/her?
Whether you send an email, CurvesConnect will send an email to that person's personal email address (for example, their yahoo or hotmail address) notifying them that your flirt has been sent. If you sent a flirt, the email notifications we send also include links back to the site so that the recipient can quickly access those messages on CurvesConnect.com.


[REF](#){: name=qD8 .ref}
####I'm a woman and I'm not used to making the initial contact. Isn't it inappropriate to send someone a flirt?
No way! In the world of online dating, initiating happens both ways. The fact that a woman initiates contact does not reflect poorly at all. Sending a flirt is a harmless and low risk way of getting someone's attention. You can pick a flirt message that is feels appropriate. You can appear very appropriate, courteous and upright. A flirt is just a way to get the ball rolling.

[REF](#){: name=qD9 .ref}
####What should I do if there is something I don't like about your site?
Speak up and let us know! Open a ticket [Support](/support). We are constantly adding to and improving the site and we want to hear from you.

[REF](#){: name=qD10 .ref}
####What are safe online dating practices?
There are some very important and basic rules to safe online dating that you should always remember.

1.  Never share your financial information (Social Security &amp; Bank Account number) with anyone online under any circumstances.
1.  Never exchange checks and/or cash with anyone unless you have built up trust with that person over a long period of time.
1.  Never send money to any member who requests it, even if that person claims to be in dire circumstances. This is a huge red flag and means you should cease contact immediately
1.  Always report members who send you mail that seems like a scam or fraudulent. Open a ticket to contact us here: [Support](/support)
1.  Remember that CurvesConnect.com members can only be from the United States or Canada. It is not permitted to access our site from abroad and anyone who is abroad should not be trusted under any circumstances.
1.  Never include your last name, e-mail address, home address, phone number, place of work, or any other identifying information in your profile or messages to other members.
1.  Stop communicating with anyone who pressures you for personal or financial information or attempts in any way to trick you into revealing it. Please report that person to us immediately [Support](/support)
1.  There is no substitute for acting with caution when communicating with any stranger who wants to meet you in person.  If you choose to have a face-to-face meeting with another member, always tell someone in your family or a friend where you are going and when you will return. Always provide your own transportation to and from your date.  And always meet in a public place with many people around. Never agree to be picked up at your home
1.  More information about safe online dating can also be found at the FTC.gov website

[REF](#){: name=qD11 .ref}
####How do I report an abusive, offensive or suspicious user?
When you receive a mail from such a user, please go the customer support page and open a new ticket.
[REF](#){: name=qD12 .ref}
####Can CurvesConnect protect users from the criminal actions of others?
The short answer is that we cannot, cannot be expected to and in no way can take on responsibility to protect users from each other. Understand that we are not the police and if you have a concern about safety, crimes or any illegal activity, you should involve your local police. We cannot arrest people or punish them. We do not make the laws and we are not law enforcement officers. Of course, we would like to address all reasonable concerns. If you send us a police report, we will read it and use it to determine whether a profile should be removed. However, before you make accusations, put yourself in our shoes: One user simply complaining about another could be a prank, an act of spite, an act of passion, or anything else. Just because one user says something about another user, that does not make the statement true. And we cannot evaluate the veracity of statements made by members about one another when the site serves 100,000s of members everyday. Be specific, be reasonable and be clear. That will help us a lot.

[REF](#){: name=qD13 .ref}
####Does CurvesConnect conduct criminal background checks?
Absolutely not. As we make clear on the site, we do not conduct such background checks. If you have concerns about a user please share them with us by opening a ticket, but remember that hearsay, “he said / she said,” and baseless accusations may not suffice to terminate an account.

[REF](#){: name=qD13.1 .ref}
####Under what circumstances will CurvesConnect ban a user?
As owners of the site, we determine what is considered inappropriate and what will be a violation that gets you banned. This includes anything lewd, fake, malicious, disparaging to users or to the site, deceitful, etc. We use our best judgment and discretion. We cannot verify your complaints on our own--we have 100,000s of users and get many incoming requests to review others’ profiles. We cannot possibly review all of them. If you complain about another profile, please be specific--the more specific you are about a complaint, the more likely someone at CurvesConnect will be able to understand it, evaluate it, and possibly act on it.

[REF](#){: name=qD13.2 .ref}
####What is considered inappropriate behavior on the site?
We use our best judgment and so should you. We are not the police, we are not your clergyman, and we are not the editors of the front page news. We welcome a plurality of views, preferences and tastes. One easy guideline: If you post something that is likely to generate complaints from more than one person, it probably is not acceptable. Also, if you act in a way which we deem inappropriate or otherwise unacceptable, we may warn other users about your behavior.

[REF](#){: name=qD13.3 .ref}
####What is your view on sexual preferences?
We welcome all users, whether straight or gay. However, harassing members with a different sexual preference from your own is a violation of our terms of use and may result in you being banned. This also goes for other preferences which people are passionate about --religion, politics, race, etc. We respect folks of all backgrounds. Everyone is welcome. But bothering members who have expressed a clear preference not be contacted by certain others is considered a violation of our terms and may result in your being banned without refund.

[REF](#){: name=qD13.4 .ref}
####What is your view on catfish?
Pretending to be someone else in any way, shape, or form, no matter how slight or expansive, is not acceptable and may result in you being banned without refund.

[REF](#){: name=qD13.5 .ref}
####What happens if someone complains about me?
If you cause another member to complain, that does not make you a criminal necessarily, but it does mean you are causing trouble for someone and causing trouble for us. That is sufficient grounds for being banned, so please be respectful, treat others kindly, and go out of your way not to cause trouble. Whether or not a complaint is acted upon is, again, something we cannot provide any guarantees about. We are not the police.

[REF](#){: name=qD13.6 .ref}
####What does CurvesConnect do to keep scammers off the site?
Discouraging scammers is important to us. We use various technologies and tools to do so. We also use our own proprietary methods which we will obviously not disclose. We care about the quality of your experience on our site and make reasonable efforts to keep scammers off. You can judge for yourself whether CurvesConnect does a good job. We believe we do.  But it is important that you understand that we cannot be responsible for scams that anyone falls victim to.

Want to know the best way to avoid scammers? It is actually really simple: Use your street smarts, be patient, don’t rush into relationships, and under no circumstance given anyone any money or financial information about yourself. Read our online dating tips. Also, consider that no one is permitted access the site outside of the USA and Canada. If someone tells you they are outside of those two countries, he/she must be lying to you. Block that user immediately and report that user to us. If you follow this basic advice, you will do more to protect yourself than any sophisticated technology out there. Again, yes, of course we care. And of course we do a lot to keep scammers off the site. But ultimately you are responsible for your actions.

[REF](#){: name=qD13.7 .ref}
####Does CurvesConnect ever send out messages to users on its own just to “spur” activity?

Very simply stated: NO WAY!

It is really sad that this question even needs be addressed but, alas, we know that some users have been burned on other sites and some of you are inherently skeptical. Therefore, we want to be very explicit: The idea of sending out messages for users without their knowledge and/or on our own is completely against everything we stand for and are striving for in building the CurvesConnect community.
